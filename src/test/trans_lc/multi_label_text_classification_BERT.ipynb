Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco was dropped to make the index more representative of the market. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickel producer, was a member of the index since 1928. Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Co and Boeing Co, effective tomorrow. Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said Inco's removal from the index would likely spark short-term selling pressure on the stock. \"Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'well, because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that investment,'\" said Martens, although he added the move was unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock. Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in 1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year. Reuter \n",

       " 'U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK\\nU.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said. Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said. \"You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now,\" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said. \"Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won\\'t be that bad for the market,\" Sloane said. Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct. Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct. Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added. Retail sales \"will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap,\" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today. Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer. \"A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range,\" Singer said. In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, \"the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,\" Singer said. \"Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level.\" The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said. Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support. \"I\\'m not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet. The jury is still out this week,\" Rozich said.

       " 'UNUSUAL TEXAS INSTRUMENTS <TXN> PREFERRED PRICED\\nIn a novel type of financing, Texas Instruments Inc marketed a three-part, 225 mln dlr issue of convertible money market preferred stock through Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc as sole manager. Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept, said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In the first, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strike price of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over the common stock price when terms were set. Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220 dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividend preferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium. Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 2-1/8. Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that \"demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for the first tranche.\" He said that Shearson originated the concept of auction money market preferred stock three years ago. The conversion feature of this issue is the new wrinkle. Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that the original pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20 pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intense demand, saving the issuer money in financing costs. The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of the first tranche received less than they wanted. He said the latter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed. Like non-convertible money market preferred stock, the new version allows investors to redeem their holdings every seven weeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them, or offer to hold on to the securities if the auction dividend is at least at a level they specify in advance. Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range of investors, including major insurance companies, banks, money managers and pension funds. Reuter \\n',\n",

The test, developed by Cetus Corp <CTUS> researchers, requires only a small amount of genetic material from a fetus and produces a diagnosis within a day, unlike other tests that require several days and can only be done in a few specialized centers, they said. Sickle cell anemia is a painful, inherited blood disease that causes the normally-flexible red blood cells to stiffen into a sickle-like shape. It is primarily found in blacks. The researchers said in The New England Journal of Medicine that their \"procedure promises to be a rapid, sensitive and reliable method for the prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell disease.\" In addition, they said, the technique might also be adapted to detect other types of genetic disease.

USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp, had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil and gas operations. About 24 pct of total sales came from USX\\'s USS steel unit and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate. According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa, where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln, reflecting the exclusion of Libya. Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985. Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic feet, excluding Libyan reserves. U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion from 1.53 trillion. In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962 mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited figure the company reported on Jan 27. USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter. In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03 billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge included the \"indefinite idling\" last month of four plants in Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas. Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled. \"These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved market conditions for the products from these plants may make it feasible to reopen some of them,\" USX said in the report. \"On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement may necessitate their permanent closing,\" it added.

       " 'PHILLIPS<P> SAYS STOCK UP ON STEPS TO PARE DEBT\\nPhillips Petroleum Co Chairman C. J. \"Pete\" Silas said his company\\'s stock, ranked fourth on the most active list of stocks traded today, rose partly because of steps it took to pare its debt. Silas told Reuters in an interview today, \"part of this strength results from the rise in oil prices and also because some of the analysts have been happy with the steps we\\'ve taken in 1986 to pare our debt.\" Phillips stocks rose 1/4 to 14 dlrs a share following recommendations by some oil analysts, a company source said. Phillips debt stood at 5.9 billion dlrs in December 1986 down from a 1985 high of 8.6 billion dlrs, analysts said. \"At 14 dlrs a share, Phillips is priced closer to the actual price of oil,\" he added. Silas said, \"if the analysts are right that oil prices will rise to 20 dlrs or higher, then it seems to make sense to buy Phillips.\" He is, however, more cautious about the strength in crude prices, expecting the price to fluctuate between 16-18 dlrs a barrel for the year. Oil industry analysts said one reason for the stock\\'s popularity of the stock is that it traded at a strong discount to its appraised value and was attractively priced for small investors. Charles Andrew, an analyst who follows Phillips for John S. Herold Inc of Greenwich, Conn said that the appraised value of the company, based on available data is 34.25 dlrs. \"The stock is trading at about 1/3 its appraised value. The company has tremendous leverage and if it can get its act together and if oil prices are steady to higher there is good room for improvement,\" he said. But, he added, \"if oil prices turn lower, there will be a lot of pressure on Phillips.\" Phillips\\' shares fell as low as eight dlrs a share over the last 52 weeks with a 1987 low of 11-3/4 dlrs in 1987. Analysts say that the appraised value of the company could be revised due to asset sales of their oil and gas reserves. Silas told Reuters that the asset sales which amount to about two billion dlrs for 1986 were completed and that none were planned. Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'U.S. HOUSE PANEL TAKES FIRST TRADE BILL VOTES\\nHouse trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year\\'s effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party\\'s 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances. \"My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,\" he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive. House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill. \"I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,\" he told reporters. The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training. The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining, safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country\\'s economic development. They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief. They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive. The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday, \"I am cautiously optimistic,\" that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill. Reuter \\n',\n",

Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec. Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec. An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other details. The other two companies were not immediately available for comment. Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France\\'s trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky told Reuters: \"It all depends on France.\" At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986. Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with \"interesting\" proposals offering latest technology and assuring \"a mutual advantage.\" He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting. He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing \"the interests of foreign partners\" in joint ventures. But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws. He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng. He said Doumeng\\'s Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods.

The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said.

MHI\\'s exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years ago. China is the most promising market, although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers. \"Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency,\" Iida said. But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support. It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future. In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport. Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the world\\'s largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity. Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects, including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites. It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence Agency\\'s F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms. MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country\\'s own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s. Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan\\'s huge trade surplus with the U.S. \"It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S. Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella,\" Iida said. MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage, he said. The U.S. Has been seeking Japan\\'s technological support. In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI\\'s sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct. As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to specify which products. \"By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on your daily products, although this does not mean we will run away from our mainstream business,\" he said.

Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries\\' annual dinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. \"Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. \"The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested,\" he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. \"The aim is to pressurise a company\\'s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future,\" he said. Such bids \"often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,\" he said. In a clear reference recent events, he said \"those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.\" They \"should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated.

He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq. In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes. Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB. The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said. However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said. Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB\\'s February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes. But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available. In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop.

The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress. President Jose Sarney\\'s government despatched troops to Brazil\\'s ports and oil installations on Tuesday. Seamen in Santos, Brazil\\'s main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country\\'s main ports. The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports. An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, \"The seamen\\'s strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic.\" The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union\\'s office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month. At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances. \"Brazil\\'s seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana\\'s,\" dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government\\'s Cruzado Plan price freeze. Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute.

       " 'SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD\\nSaudi Arabia\\'s 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom\\'s still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\" The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia\\'s corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom\\'s banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom\\'s nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, <United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985\\'s shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp\\'s <CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply. <Arab National Bank>\\'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions.\" From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom\\'s largest bank <National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB\\'s rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by the <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good.\" Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account. REUTER \\n',\n",

Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world\\'s third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas. \"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,\" Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month\\'s failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world\\'s second largest producer, but gave no details. \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,\" Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia\\'s case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country\\'s coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\" The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia\\'s coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year\\'s level of 360,000 tonnes, he said.

       " 'TAIWAN CLAMPS NEW CONTROLS ON CURRENCY INFLOWS\\nTaiwan\\'s new controls on currency inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said. The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source. Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to genuine commercial transactions. Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight, insurance and royalties, to the central bank. But bankers said they believed the new controls would be ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan\\'s flourishing currency black market. The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to slow the growth of Taiwan\\'s exports to the U.S. The government has denied local press reports Washington is pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs. The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70. \"I don\\'t think the central bank has a final target,\" said an executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the Taiwan dollar will rise. Taiwan\\'s trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year. Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative money flowed into Taiwan in 1986. This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last year and provided further upward pressure on the currency. The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging speculators. Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week Washington\\'s pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable. Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow the local dollar to find its own level. \"Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want to take the risk,\" said one local banker. He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with the exchange rate problem. The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt around the real issue, he said. Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank. \"The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,\" said the manager of a European bank. Economists criticised the controls, saying they could antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic liberalisation in Taiwan. \"Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has restricted inflows,\" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers da Costa. A local banker, who declined to be named, said, \"It\\'s basically ridiculous. It\\'s a backward movement and goes against the government\\'s liberalisation programme.\" Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country each year.

       " 'AUSTRALIA EXPECTS RISE IN MEAT EXPORTS TO MIDEAST\\nAustralia expects meat and livestock exports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend this year, managing director of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corp, Peter Frawley, said. He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate and less competition from the European Community should lead in the Gulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000 tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year. \"In the last three to four months there has been a resurgence of inquiries,\" he said. Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess market potential. On beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in European Community intervention stock in the past 12 months would help Australian sales. The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in these markets, where the Australian trade was the natural source of supply, and Australia was \"now back in,\" Frawley said. He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether the Middle East market for livestock, which accounts for two-thirds of meat export value to the area, would be maintained. He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand for fresh meat. The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia, the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with 2,939,226 in 1985. The numbers shipped to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain fell, however. Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been offset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean. Other than livestock, Australia\\'s overall meat sales to the Middle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnes the previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes of mutton and lamb to Iran. Australia sold 9,824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after being virtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several years. Frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included a barter provision, but Iran had paid in full in cash. Negotiations with the Iranians for 1987 shipments were currently under way, with Iran again seeking credit and barter provisions, he said. Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he predicted this would continue. \"The Middle East, and the Gulf in particular, is now Australia\\'s largest market for lamb, chilled and flown in. Australia is in an ideal position to provide the supplies if the market is willing to pay a premium for a fresh, young product,\" he said. REUTER \\n',\n",

The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers\\' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang. It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump. The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin, the bulletin said. A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms, it added. \"Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo,\" the bulletin said.

       " 'ECUADOR SEEKS HALT TO PAYMENTS TO BANKS IN 1987\\nEcuador, stricken by a severe earthquake, is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year, Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said. He said in a statement, \"The idea with the foreign banks is to obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadorean economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments on the foreign debt during the present year.\" The statement referred only to payments due to private foreign banks, a senior government finance official told Reuters. These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador\\'s foreign debt which totals 8.16 billion dlrs. It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder of Ecuador\\'s foreign debt, the official said. He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450 and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year. Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans from multilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due here soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said. Ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40 foreign governments. Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987 budget from last Thursday\\'s earthquake at 926 mln dlrs. In 1986, Ecuador\\'s total service on the foreign debt was about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors. The quake ruptured Ecuador\\'s main oil pipeline, suspending crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil accounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60 pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended interest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks. Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a cash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices, which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs. Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its 14-bank advisory committee, the senior government finance official said. The committee represents the country\\'s 400 or so private foreign bank creditors. Cordovez also said in the statement, \"The banks should perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with what was forseen.\" Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in line with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions.\" Interest payments fall due at least monthly to private foreign banks. Ecuador\\'s initial proposal earlier this year was to make only one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year. Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments until June at the earliest, foreign bankers and government officials here said. Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with the advisory committee in New York in January, but the negotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12-hour kidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air force paratroopers. The Red Cross says that least 300 people died and at least 4,000 are missing due to the earthquake. REUTER \\n',\n",

Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries\\' annual dinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. \"Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. \"The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested,\" he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. \"The aim is to pressurise a company\\'s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future,\" he said. Such bids \"often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,\" he said. In a clear reference recent events, he said \"those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.\" They \"should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated.

Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached. The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake. Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador's export commitments. But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.

Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said. The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs. Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year. Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors. A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group. Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany. Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct. Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future. Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year. REUTER \\n\",\n",

Board member Herbert Mittendorf told a news conference that Brazil\\'s example was unlikely to be followed by other Latin American countries. He pointed out that the region\\'s debt rose by only 2.8 pct last year to a total 396 billion dlrs. The countries\\' efforts to further economic growth and to consolidate budgets were \"not unsuccessful.\" But the slump in oil prices and the decline in commodity prices hampered these efforts, he said. Latin American countries\\' exports fell last year by about 16 pct to 80 billion dlrs, with imports declining slightly to around 65 billion dlrs, Mittendorf said. The region\\'s 1986 trade surplus was halved to an estimated 15 billion dlrs, he said. The cut in exchange earnings of oil exporting countries was only partly offset by the advantages gained by the region\\'s oil importing states, he noted. The region\\'s principal debtors are Brazil and Mexico, each owing about 100 billion dlrs at the end of last year, followed by Argentina with around 49 billion dlrs, Venezuela with 33 billion and Chile with 20 billion dlrs debt. Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank welcomed Mexico joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in mid 1986, which it saw as an effort to integrate the country to a larger extent into the world economy. However, realistic exchange rates were needed if the debtor countries were to compete in the world market, Mittendorf said. In this respect an easing of protectionist barriers was imperative, he said. The conversion of debt into equity was regarded as an important additional step towards debt consolidation. West German exports to Latin America declined by 4.1 pct in 1986 to 11 billion marks. Shipments to Mexico fell 19 pct to 1.9 billion marks and to Colombia by 15 pct to 600 mln marks, Mittendorf said. Exports to Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Central America were also lower last year than in 1985, while shipments to Brazil rose 11.5 pct to around two billion marks. Exports to Argentina went up by over three pct to 1.5 billion marks and those to Paraguay surged by 42 pct to 106 mln marks, he said.

But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a \"hard and fast formula.\" Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make concessions to the United States on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture. Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years. A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is hoped to be presented to Congress in October. \"It\\'s a very tight time frame,\" Ontario\\'s Peterson said last night. \"But at this moment it is tough to say what will transpire.\" Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'BALDRIGE OPPOSES JAPANESE PURCHASE OF FIRM\\nCommerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S. officials said. The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that Baldrige has \"serious concerns\" about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics firm. The officials told Reuters that if the sale went through it could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering. In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan stemming from the huge Japanese surplus. The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks, they said. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger\\'s position was not immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments and companies.

       " 'SAND TECHNOLOGY <SNDCF> MULLING REVERSE SPLIT\\nSand Technology Systems Inc said it is considering a reverse stock split of at least one-for-10 and expects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a loss last year. The stock consolidation \"is something we\\'re discussing, but it\\'s not definite,\" Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner told Reuters in an interview. A private placement recently brought the number of outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July 31, 1986, the fiscal yearend. \"The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,\" Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange. Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs, for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third quarter should be about the same as the second, he added. Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195 dlrs in the second quarter. After \"a disastrous first quarter,\" Sand hopes to break even in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the 33.5 mln dlrs projected in December. The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and Canadian dollars last year led to Sand\\'s loss of 2.1 mln dlrs, or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs. In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost 1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585 dlrs. Shattner believes the company will post better results this year due to several factors. \"Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the second quarter,\" he said. Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd <HIT> of Japan. Shattner said Sand\\'s affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc, is developing software that lets large maniframe computers handle large databases and share them between applications. It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major corporations. The company has also reduced costs through some staff cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff instead of straight commissions, Shattner said. And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth fiscal quarter, Shattner said. Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY\\nThe worst may be just about over for Japan\\'s battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economy\\'s 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said. But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said. Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing. The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year. Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery. Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end. And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said. Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels. The yen\\'s 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market. \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said. If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said. A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said. Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government\\'s tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. The next reading of the economy\\'s health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986. Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct. But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity. To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong. The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said. Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government\\'s sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986. Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said. As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government\\'s contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said. Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good. The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected, while that of the external sector was better. REUTER \\n',\n",

The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, Nigel Whittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would further help sales during the summer.

       " 'MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS\\nMost Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC\\'s official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. \"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,\" one Japanese refiner said. \"We don\\'t intend to put pressure on them,\" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country\\'s surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC\\'s December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea\\'s Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, \"At the moment there\\'s a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I\\'m beginning to trust their ability.\" Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, \"Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\" He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude. A Japanese refiner said, \"The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.\" \\n',\n",

K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from \"merchandising, refurbishing and expense control.\" A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago. K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said \"the success of these programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached this milestone.\" Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8 billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over 1985, it said. Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer acceptance of K Mart\\'s apparel merchandise, \"a marked increase in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from specialty retailing operations.\" K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from 372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8 pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in 1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct. K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct in 1985. \"Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K Mart,\" Fauber said in a statement. \"In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on changing the look of our stores and the structure of the company.\" K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system, upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured its long-term debt. \"We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment community.

Brazil announced on February 20 that it was suspending interest repayments on about 68 billion dlrs of private sector debt owed to commercial banks. Rockefeller said the recent tour by Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro of major industrial nations was a sign that Brazil wanted to be cooperative. But it was notable that Funaro did not meet with the creditors immediately affected, the commercial bankers, he added. Brazil\\'s moratorium on commercial debt becomes critical by end-May, when payments would be 90 days overdue, obliging U.S. Regulators to downgrade Brazilian debt, financial sources said. This would require banks in turn to cease accruing interest and set aside expensive loan loss reserves. Rockefeller reminded bankers of the depth of concern over Latin American debt at the Toronto World Bank/International Monetary Fund meeting in 1982, and said an accord would be reached in the current circumstances just as it had been then. \"(Brazilian authorities) have no more interest in seeing their credit sources cut off then we have in seeing their obligations stop,\" he added.

       " 'PHILLIPS <P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT\\nPhillips Petroleum Co will emphasize improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt, C.J. \"Pete\" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview. \"Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets already installed,\" he said, but he declined to estimate annual cash flow for 1987. Analysts estimate Phillips\" cash flow at over one billion dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986. Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas properties. \"We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash flow prospects,\" he said. He projected a capital expenditure budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln dlrs. Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas said. \"Phillips\\' top priority in 1987 will be to get the waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,\" Silas said. Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross barrels of oil over a period of 24 years. Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas said he was seeking \"a modification of terms with the Chinese government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang fields) commercially viable.\" In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. \"We expect to start up the first platform then,\" Silas said. But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the company to part with several oil and gas assets. Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K. North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in 1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is now completed, Silas said. \"We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good value for us but possibly so for someone else,\" Silas said. Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings for the company. \"Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt,\" Silas said. He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil prices don\\'t fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels for several months. \"Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of assets), and we\\'re no different from the others,\" Silas said. In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985. \"This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs for our operations,\" Silas said, \"In 1987 we think the market\\'s supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock and energy costs will rise due to price recovery.\" Reuter \\n',\n",

They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member\\'s production quota. Saudi Arabia\\'s quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world\"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC\\'s December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs. \"Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,\" he said. The sources said the kingdom\\'s exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom\\'s main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.

Progress in the Philippines talks, following recent agreements with Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, will help to dispel concerns of a new debt crisis, Mulford told the conference.

In particular, he urged the banks to develop a \"menu of options for supporting debtor reforms as a means of maintaining broad bank participation in new financing packages.\" Mulford said the banks should be able to offer a range of options to members of the lending syndicates, provided that the liquidity value of the total transactions to the debtor nations is equivalent to the banks\\' new money obligation. He said it is more important to find ways of encouraging banks to remain in the syndicates than to find ways of enabling them to quit the lending groups.

       " \"BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS\\nBritish Telecommunications Plc's <BTY.L> profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said. Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems in Britain for three to five years. He said <Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor. Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of British Telecom's most profitable areas. One company official privately estimated that British Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct. The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said. However, he forecast that the last quarter's results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout. He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at 50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities. But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength, economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future. British Telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover. Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's close and off an early high of 248p. Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion. Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising prices was limited as long as inflation remains low. Reuter \\n\",\n",
       " 'NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED\\nThe Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said. IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil\\'s position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas. \"The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely,\" one Santos exporter said. A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures. Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry. Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year. The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set. With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said. They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day. If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month. \"The problem would be how to limit sales,\" one exporter said. Brazil\\'s present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings. However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil\\'s dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war. General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO. The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks. With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added. However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers\\' markets.

       " 'PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS\\nA Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers, grain traders and officials said. Under the terms of Portugal\\'s January 1986 accession to the European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country\\'s annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders. Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon\\'s civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders. Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings. A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court\\'s decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn. Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC\\'s participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal\\'s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency\\'s import monopoly. It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders. Traders said they believed the EC\\'s Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue. \"They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile,\" one trader said. ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary. Reuter \\n',\n",
       " 'U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS\\nU.S. retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak. February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January\\'s sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously reported 5.8 pct decline. \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales probably won\\'t be boosted by auto sales as they were in February.\" Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy report.\" He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. \"There are signs of life in the economy,\" McCarthy said. \"But it\\'s jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future.\" A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February, he said. \"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks,\" he said. \"When people in this country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination is to go out and spend it,\" he said. Economists said tomorrow\\'s release of U.S. auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion\\'s share of total February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the strength in the February report is less than impressive. \"There is strength in the February data, but that\\'s because they were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don\\'t see it as a precursor of continued strength.\" Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling 17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained 1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February, following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. \"On average, it looks like they\\'ll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don\\'t look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along.\" \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing,\" he said. \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in April to sort things out.\" Reuter \\n',\n",

       " \"SEC REMOVES OBSTACLE TO FOREIGN FUTURES TRADING\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futures on designated foreign debt securities on U.S. exchanges. The move would allow the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, for approval of a futures contract on yen bonds. The CBT has said it may apply for approval of the yen bond futures contract, a CFTC spokesman said. The SEC's action, which was approved by a 4-0 vote, specifically removes a regulation against trading futures on designated foreign government debt securities on contract markets that are not located in the country that issued those securities. Futures on the government debt securities of Japan, Canada and Great Britain can already be marketed in the United States under a designated exemption issued by the SEC. But the new move would permit U.S. exchanges to apply to the CFTC for approval of establishing futures contracts on those securities, SEC officials said. The new SEC move would also allow those foreign government debt securities to be marketed in the United States by countries other than those that issued the securities, the officials said. Since the foreign government securities underlying the futures cannot be traded in the United States unless they are registered with the SEC, settlement and delivery of the futures would often take place in the foreign country, the SEC officials said. The SEC is also considering expanding futures trading of additional countries' government securities to be marketed and traded in the United States, the officials said. Reuter \\n\",\n",

       " \"GERMAN BANKS SAY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMY GROWING\\nUncertainty is growing about the prospects for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro Association said. Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said in a report. However, last month's agreement among the six leading western industrialized countries to keep currencies around present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for exporters, it added. The banking association said the possibility of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be overestimated. Another small drop in already low interest rates could not be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of consumer or capital goods, it said. The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for any further monetary moves, the association added. On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the third quarter. The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively weak.

       " \"UNION PACIFIC <UNP> TO SELL PART OF REFINERY\\nUnion Pacific Corp said it will sign a pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA, to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi, Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary. The sale will also include the related marketing and distribution system for the refinery's products. A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be issued later today giving details of the transaction. There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New York. The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000 barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the transaction. The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector. Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked for in any acquisition. One PDVSA official said the company was looking for independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution network and a strong regional presence. The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's <SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary. In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock. The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured source of supply, trade sources said. In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other feedstocks. Reuter \\n\",\n",

The federation, the nation\\'s largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jay Hair, the federation\\'s executive vice president, called the Interior\\'s research into the effects of development \"so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision.\" Hair called the department\\'s proposal a \"reflection of a largely political decision,\" adding \"we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.\" Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area\\'s caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior\\'s report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior\\'s study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior\\'s study was inadquate to make a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil. reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'FRN MARKET SLUMPS, FIXED RATE EUROBOND TRADE QUIET\\nEurobond prices in the floating rate note sector slumped across the board by as much as a full point on some issues. \"Today has been irrational, irresponsible -- possibly the worst day in what has been a dire six months for the floater market,\" commented a senior FRN trader at a U.K. Bank. Republic of Ireland FRNs were marked sharply down in initial trading and market nerves soon infected other supra-national and sovereign paper with dealers attributing the falls to aggressive professional shorting by a few leading U.S. Investment houses. The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction of liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate issues late last year. Since then, FRN specialists noted that retail interest has been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to manipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers. Floating rate debt of U.S. And Canadian banks came under pressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposure to Latin American debt. Canadian banks were hard hit today. Fears about the Irish economy, exacerbated by recent post-electoral political wrangling in Dublin, prompted a sell-off of Ireland paper this morning with both dollar and mark-denominated Irish issues tumbling by a full point or more. However, FRN dealers polled by Reuters felt the Irish issues had been singled out -- as the U.S. And Canadian banks were most recently -- as the market\\'s most vulnerable sector. \"A handful of professional houses are targetting the weak paper, shorting it aggressively and this is just starting the domino effect with basically sound paper also starting to roll with it,\" a senior FRN market source explained. Although floating paper from better-regarded borrowers such as the U.K. Managed to finish the day only around 10 basis points down, other sovereigns like Sweden and supranationals like Eurofima suffered heavier losses, FRN dealers said. Debt exposure fears continued to undermine U.S. And Canadian bank paper with one U.K. House citing a fall of 1-5/8 point on the day on a Royal Bank of Canada issue. FRN traders noted Japanese investors, initially enthusiastic floating rate debt buyers, had lost confidence in the market and speculated that a crisis meeting, such as the one called upon the collapse of the perpetuals, could be imminent. \"Retail clients just don\\'t want to know about the floaters any more so it has degenerated to a wily pass-the-parcel among the professionals, all scheming to sweep the paper under the carpet,\" another senior FRN trader said. \"I don\\'t know what is going to happen to the market. It can\\'t go on like this,\" he added. In the fixed-rate sector, trading was dull with the market still attempting to digest a heavy volume of new issues from earlier this week although primary market activity slowed somewhat today, trading and syndicate sources reported. Dollar straight bonds ended the day barely changed from opening levels as investors failed to react on the unexpectedly large 4.1 pct rise in U.S. February retail sales, prefering to wait for tomorrow\\'s producer price and business inventory data. A 100 mln dlr deal for Norsk Hydro was launched later in the day and the issue was trading around its total two pct fees at close of grey market trade although dealers said the borrower\\'s frequent appearance in the euromarkets could deter investors. The Canadian dollar sector however saw good two-way trade and a continuation of recent healthy volume as the Canadian dollar rides high on the foreign exchanges and futures markets. Dealers said the strength of the Canadian dollar, which has firmed especially over the last two days, has renewed end investors confidence in the currency. A new Canadian dollar issue for Hydro Quebec was seeing excellent demand, sector specialists said, and the issue was quickly increased to a total of 150 mln dlrs from 125 mln. \"This kind of paper can be hard to sell and it is gratifying to see such a high level of interest, both European and domestic Canadian demand,\" commented one trader at a Canadian house. Eurosterling, which has been in the limelight lately, also on foreign exchange and currency bullishness, slipped slightly. Senior eurosterling sources noted that bond prices fell back today, more or less in line with losses seen on the U.K. Government bond market -- around 5/8 point lower at the longer end of the eurosterling market. Dealers said overseas investors had not been buying today and predicted consolidation before next week\\'s U.K. Budget. A 55 mln stg convertible issue for confectioners Rowntree Mackintosh was well bid at 104-5/8 105-1/8 pct and expected to go well. Euroyen bonds showed a firmer tone led by some professional short covering from Tokyo. Today\\'s 23 billion deal for Toyota Motor Credit with a 4-1/2 pct coupon was deemed tight however.

However, Lyng said he did not want to make a \"definitive commitment one way or another at this point.\" Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln tonnes each of corn and wheat. Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.

       " 'RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS\\nThere has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement, INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said. \"There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet,\" he said. The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price, and the \"may buy\" (or \"may sell\") and \"must buy\" (or \"must sell\") levels without changing the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five-day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price, set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo, and of the \"lower indicative price\" if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.

       " '\"BRITANNIA\" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM\\nThe new British one ounce gold coin, the \"Britannia,\" will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the day of purchase plus a \"competitive premium,\" Treasury officials said. Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins. Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the place of the South African krugerrand, the British government still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold. Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases. No details are yet available on how many coins will be issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price. There were some enquiries on the \"Britannia\" from coin dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put off many investors, traders said. Some said that the \"Britannia\" had come too late, with the Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins already well established. Reuter \\n',\n",

Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude. Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said. Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said. The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said. In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct capacity, a company spokesman said. Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR) will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day. Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however, traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished in two to three weeks. As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the situation may ease by mid-April. Reuter \\n\",\n",

Standard and Poor's noted that Resorts International remains highly leveraged, with significant near-term financing requirements for the completion of its new casino/hotel in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal.

       " 'PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP\\nPessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year\\'s crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year\\'s output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year\\'s record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.

       " 'TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP <PCC>\\nPurolator Courier corp\\'s stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would find a new suitor for the company, traders said. Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265 mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of its Purolator courier division\\'s management. The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one. Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10. The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier division. \"Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has 450 mln dlrs in revenues. It\\'s a very large company and it\\'s being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,\" said Gardner in a telephone interview with Reuters. Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he personally owns 20,000 shares. A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from Gardner. Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor. While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again. \"There\\'s no shortage of possibilities. It\\'s just a question of management\\'s willingness to let the process continue,\" said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction. Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs cash per share. The balance of Purolator\\'s stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S. courier operations. The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in Purolator. \"As far as I can tell from the public documents from the deal that\\'s on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero. One always likes a situation like that. You always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher,\" said one arbitrager. The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position. While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some risk to the firm. \"There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash, and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,\" said one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to employees. The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs in so-called \"bridge\" financing for the transaction. The bridge financing is a temporary loan from Hutton. The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing, expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm. Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale. \"It\\'s a very complex transaction, but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place,\" Gardner said.

       " 'GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN\\nImplementation of a one-year 0/92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions. \"We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame, but we are locked into this,\" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains. \"We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.\" Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week. Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill -- only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under the current bill. It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill, he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed. A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said. Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point, he said. \"I don\\'t think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,\" Glickman said at the hearing. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term 0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan. Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions. \"I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but we can at least move in that direction,\" Boschwitz said. Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers\\' dependency on the government, he said. A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson said, and would still encourage farmers to plant. Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen\\'s Association said their groups oppose any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers. But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

I hope there won\\'t be any change, but there could be,\" Holden-Brown told reporters after a speech in Toronto. He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct. \"Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion for either the put or call to be exercised,\" Holden-Brown said. In answer to a reporter\\'s question, Holden-Brown said it would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49 pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons\\' consent. \"I don\\'t think we would have any objection to it,\" he added. Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham\\'s board of directors and has total responsibility for its management. \"We cannot contemplate giving up our control,\" he said. Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons\\' financial results, but he said \"it will be substantial.\" \"I am not able to give profit forecasts,\" he said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings, and has no current plans for a stock issue. He said the company is not currently negotiating any more acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food concerns. \"I don\\'t think we shall be looking at the brewery scene (which is) highly concentrated already,\" he added. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares on Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year. Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'CARGILL OFFICIAL DEFENDS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS\\nThe use of generic in-kind commodity certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a necessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive for the world\\'s largest grain company said. Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies have made huge profits from certificate trading. \"The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the trade,\" he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that this is within the normal grain marketing levels. Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs. Certificates are also an important part of any export promotion program, he said. \"The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain into the market to meet demand,\" he said.

       " 'BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT\\nBolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president Jier Nogales said. Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia\\'s creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month. He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value. Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full. Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added. Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time. Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates. Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months. He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer. He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added. \"We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable,\" Nogales said. \"Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all.\" \"The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year, but I don\\'t know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time,\" he added. Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia\\'s four billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club. He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules, he added. He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt. He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year. The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added. Nogales said that Bolivia\\'s net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August, 1985. Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a year in the government\\'s first month in office, was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the plan was that it should continue at this level. He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates. Reuter \\n',\n",

Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.

The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year. But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut by those countries. The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls, incentives for research, expanded worker training and education and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness. The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate committees. It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by U.S. actions against other countries. The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win relief from surges of imports of competitive products. It extends until January 1993, the administration\\'s authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.

       " \"LIVE CATTLE RALLY AS LOCKOUT AT MEAT PLANT ENDS\\nLive cattle futures posted a robust rally today after a major beef packing company said it would end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City, Neb. April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closed at 64.45 cents a pound, up 0.83 cent, as the market expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant restarts operations. Iowa Beef Processors, a division of Occidental Petroleum, said it planned to reopen the plant, one of the largest in the nation, on March 16. The plant has been closed since Dec. 14, the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired. The plant employs 2,800 workers and can slaughter several thousand animals a day, a company spokesman said. The company said it locked out union workers because they threatened to disrupt operations. It was unclear whether union meatpackers would return to work. They rejected the company's latest contract offer March 5. Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors circulated that the lockout was ending, and gains were further fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle. The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and frozen pork bellies, which also were supported by indications that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate than previously expected. Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday, said Nauman Barakat, petroleum analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices recover from early weakness, traders said. Gold futures rallied, partly in response to strength in the silver market, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver prices rallied after a U.S. brokerage house recommended its customers buy the metal, traders said. Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that Colombia lowered the price of its exports, traders said. Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European Commission on Wednesday. Soybeans were higher, wheat lower and corn mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave highly erodible land idle instead of planting a crop, traders said. Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt exports of soybeans from Brazil, where the harvest is just beginning, also underpinned prices, they said.

       " 'BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA\\nBrazil\\'s state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil\\'s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil\\'s terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia\\'s traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are \"reasonably balanced.\" Saudi Arabia is Brazil\\'s second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added.

       " 'FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY\\nU.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is \"on hold\" and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said. \"The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy,\" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co. \"These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change,\" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc. Fed data released today were all in line with economists\\' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks. The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that. It said that banks\\' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously. Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs. Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3. February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target. \"In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth,\" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February\\'s anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness. Commenting on February\\'s decline in the key M-2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February\\'s weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March. Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed. Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves. Given the economy\\'s fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy. \"Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct,\" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week. The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases. Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs. Reuter \\n',\n",
       " 'COLOMBIA\\'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE\\nColombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar Gaviria said. Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile. \"In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia\\'s coffee export policy,\" he said. Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends. Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term. ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986. Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume. \"Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do so without an agreement among producers,\" he said. He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles, \"because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market.\" Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30. Echoing Gaviria\\'s words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national coffee growers\\' federation, said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances. \"There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future,\" he told journalists. Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil\\'s future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week. Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved. Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear. He said Brazil\\'s current quota \"reflects the reality of the market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,\" but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it. Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible, which did not happen.

       " 'INVESTORS MORE ACTIVE IN GILT MARKET, SURVEY SAYS\\nInstitutional investors are finding it difficult to find \"the best price\" for transactions in U.K. Government bonds (gilts) and have become more active in the market since the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange in October, agency broker Capel-Cure Myers said in a survey. The survey, covering a broad section of institutional investors, also showed that investors were uneasy about the impartiality of market makers\\' advice. Given their concerns, over half those surveyed said they spend more time managing their portfolios. At the same time, the investors believed the market was more liquid and efficient than before Big Bang. Capel-Cure, a unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, conducted the survey during January among 70 institutions which are not clients of that firm. Banks and merchant banks accounted for 32 pct of the total, building societies 30 pct, life assurance companies 20 pct, insurance companies 11 pct and pension funds seven pct. The survey found that with the virtual elimination of commissions, the improved market liquidity has encouraged investors to deal more frequently in the market. Of those responding, 70 pct were encouraged to deal more actively, 25 pct which saw no change and five pct dealt less actively. A Capel-Cure official told reporters the elimination of commissions has made the market more competitive. He said Capel-Cure has deliberately set low commisstions because of this. Nearly half the respondents said they now have their own dealing team to cope with the new market, although the definition of a \"dealing team\" was ambiguous, the survey said. Rather than being a self-contained, specialised group of dealers who spend all their time searching for prices, the definition now appears to be the less formal idea of a multi-purpose fund manager, it said. The survey supported the general view in the gilt market that a shake-out of the 27 market-makers is likely. It showed nearly 90 pct of the respondents believed that the total number of market makers in three years time would be less than 20, while 46 pct thought the number would be less than 15. Some 79 pct of respondents said they expect the number of agency brokers (for which there was no estimate) to fall over the next three years. Unlike broker/dealers, agency brokers do not take positions in the market, but the survey showed 68 pct of respondents did not consider this very important when deciding whether to use one.

He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador\\'s Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August. Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador\\'s 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action.

Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.

       " 'PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS FINELY POISED, BANKERS SAY\\nDebt talks between the Philippine government and its bank advisory committee were delicately poised after a brief meeting between the two sides today, bankers and sources close to the Philippine delegation said. \"We had a businesslike meeting and made good progress,\" a banker said. \"The banks are anxious to come to an agreement.\" But bankers were reluctant to predict whether the talks would end successfully. Caution was also evident in the Philippine camp. \"We feel the ball\\'s in the banks\\' court,\" one source said. The two sides will meet again on Friday. The talks, in which the Philippines is seeking to reschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt, are now dominated by a discussion of the innovative proposal made by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country\\'s interest bill in Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, instead of cash. Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate in cash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR. The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday, but Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which sought to satisfy the banks\\' objections by guaranteeing that the notes would yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash. The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on the new proposal. Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warm support for the PINs proposal this week, which gave Ongpin hope that the banks would embrace the idea. But the banks are still being circumspect, weighing possible accounting consequences as well as considering the precedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS. One of the main architects of the PINs proposal, U.S. lawyer Lee Buchheit, is adamant that the banks have nothing to worry about. \"To the extent that it\\'s a precedent, it\\'s a precedent to be encouraged,\" Buchheit, a partner with Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, told a debt-equity swaps conference sponsored by Euromoney magazine. Under the proposal, banks would sell the dollar-denominated PINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convert them into pesos at face value to fund government-approved equity investments in the Philippines. In effect, international firms would be paying part of Manila\\'s interest bill, allowing the government to conserve much-needed hard currency. One of the beauties of the scheme, according to Buchheit, is that it widens the scope of third-world debt negotiations, which have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past 4-1/2 years. \"There\\'s another pool of cash at the table now,\" he said. David Mulford, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, told the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should be part of a \"menu\" of options available to banks instead of pure new-money packages. He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexico\\'s 7.7 billion dlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged. \"We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising new money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank syndications,\" Mulford said. In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal, he said that dissatisfaction with Mexico\\'s economic program and criticism of communication and coordination within the bank syndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse to participate in the loan. This refusal \"for a time appeared to jeopardize the prospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks,\" Mulford said. The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20, but bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe new life into the financing process, especially with crucial negotiations with Brazil, about to start. The banks for their part insist that they are more than willing to discuss Mulford\\'s \"menu\", and say it is the debtors that need to be more flexible. For example, they say financing talks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Aires dislikes the debt-equity schemes and onlending provisions that the banks are promoting. But whether the banks are ready to endorse the PINs concept right away still hangs in the balance. Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT\\nSenior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration\\'s opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth. By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty good to me. We\\'ve had two very strong employment reports.\" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, \"It looks like they\\'re on track.\" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.\" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said. \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office\\'s Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,\" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation in our nation\\'s history,\" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. \"The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,\" Penner said. \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.\" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed. \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there\\'s no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets. \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,\" Penner said. REUTER \\n',\n",

       " 'CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS\\nChina has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said. He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details. One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods. \"It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. China may have to import,\" he said. Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986. The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand. The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes. \"In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,\" it said. \"The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,\" it added. It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them. The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane. Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said. In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills\\' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added. The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills. A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China\\'s sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China\\'s sugar in calendar 1985. He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities. But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said. He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986. A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. \"Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,\" he said. \"China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,\" he said. The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988. He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers. \"Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,\" he said. He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct. REUTER \\n',\n",

Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to 480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of its bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts. It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is expected to be slower than previously forecast. Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will continue, the AMLC said. The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and domestic consumption this year, it said. The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production levels until late next year. It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55 pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct. The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the Australian dollar, the AMLC said.

The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT in the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year. The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply nearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport Ministry guidelines.

       " \"SINGAPORE MONETARY EXCHANGE FACES NON-ASIAN RIVALS\\nExpanding global links between futures markets mean that the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) must add Chicago and London to its list of rivals, banking sources said. When SIMEX and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) introduced U.S. Treasury bond futures last autumn, the sources expected to see fierce rivalry between the two exchanges, ending with only one winner in Asia. But surprisingly, the challenges now appear to be coming from the other side of the world, they said. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) will introduce night trading in its U.S. Treasury bond contract on April 30, which could clash with SIMEX morning activity, banking sources said. The CBOT had planned to introduce night trading on April 2, but postponed the move to allow participants time to prepare. The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) could cut further into the SIMEX contract with a U.S. Treasury bond contract that can be offset on the CBOT, they said. Such a LIFFE contract is expected later this year. LIFFE liquidity could be higher than at the SIMEX, where average daily volume in Treasury bonds dropped to 165 in February from 1,286 last October when the bonds were first introduced. The contracts were set up to attract hedging from the rapidly growing underlying cash market in U.S. Treasury bonds in Toyko, but interest has waned as that market has grown more stable, traders said. Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have also inhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singapore and Sydney, the banking sources said. Nevertheless, all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken, with the last trading at 55,000 dlrs against the initial price of 50,000 dlrs. The current bid is 55,500 dlrs, but offers at 65,000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains, said Michael Killian, general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp. Killian, a SIMEX board member, said the CBOT night session might raise arbitrage opportunities and SIMEX would benefit from a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end of 1987. SIMEX also became more competitive after this month's budget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futures margin deposits. Banking sources said the tax change would boost SIMEX trading by non-bank institutions and individuals and would benefit foreign firms and institutions. While the Treasury bond contract has been somewhat disappointing, other SIMEX contracts continue to expand, Fong Yew Meng, SIMEX assistant general manager, told Reuters. Volume in the SIMEX's Nikkei stock index, based on the Tokyo stock market, has risen to a daily average of more than 1,000 contracts this month, from 320 contracts last October, helped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in Tokyo stocks, Fong said. Open interest in the Nikkei contract, introduced last year, reached a record 2,697 on February 26. Killian said the Nikkei contract has considerable potential for expansion, as overseas investors have been avoiding the contract because they currently see no need to hedge the rising cash market in Tokyo. SIMEX is also enjoying record trading in other contracts. In February, total volume on the exchange reached a record 122,819 contracts, surpassing the previous monthly record of 116,767 set in September. Eurodollar volume reached a record 78,546 contracts last month against 70,306 in September. SIMEX is likely to try to maintain its growth by moving into options soon, but competition continues regionally as well as globally, banking sources said. The Sydney exchange plans to introduce by June a share index futures contract based on a composite of stocks on which equity options are traded, which could generate more liquidity than the ordinary index, banking sources said. Local interest in the Sydney Treasury bond contract may also flare if the Sydney exchange establishes a three-way link with Chicago and London, traders in Sydney said. LIFFE is discussing such a link with the CBOT, they said. REUTER \\n\",\n",

U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan\\'s Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T>, U.S. Officials said yesterday. Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale. U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan\\'s supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales. Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner, Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, does not include Fairchild\\'s main defence-related division. In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers. Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said. Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying \"the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market.\" Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said. The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said. U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms\\' technological lead in the field. \"The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,\" Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said. However, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors. \"The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,\" said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.

Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985. Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Daily attributed the decline to several factors, including less favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict cotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks. According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to 558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985. To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota levels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencies will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally contracted for, it added. The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south China should be maintained, and growing in the north should be concentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang.

The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said. The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the \"one pct\" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident. However, the official said the final figure would be \"much less than that cited in earlier comments.\" He gave no further details. In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy <CIGZ.Z>, which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said. Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.

That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen.\" He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years\\' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company\\'s remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this \"radical elimination of the mortgages of the past\" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company\\'s liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders\\' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years.

An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal fault in the employers' redundancy procedure. The employers' spokesman said they were likely to restart the redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to pre-empt the May 7 final court ruling. Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller described the court ruling as a victory for the union, but added there was still a long way to go before the dispute that has hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was resolved. Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sector's 4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the campaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 this year. The employers said there were no immediate plans for meetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or on a new work practice agreement in the sector. Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in the port's grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated, although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector, the employers' spokesman added.

The increase came after a 0.6 pct increase in producer prices in January. Higher energy prices were primarily responsible for the increase in February, though they rose at a slower pace than they had in January, the department said. The finished goods index was up 0.1 pct from its February, 1986 level. Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goods stood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100.

But price increases slowed sharply for gasoline and home heating oil, the department said. There were some price declines, including a 3.4 pct fall for passenger cars and 1.3 pct for light trucks from January levels.

The index for intermediate goods rose 0.5 pct following a sharp 0.9 pct rise in January. The department said that energy prices again were the main reason, with the index for intermediate energy up 2.7 pct. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices were about five pct higher, half the 10 pct jump recorded in January. The durable manufacturing materials index edged down 0.1 pct last month after jumping 1.0 pct in January as prices for steel, precious metals and copper stabilized. The department said lead and zinc prices fell, while hardwood lumber and cement cost more. The crude materials index rose 1.8 pct in February after a 2.9 pct rise in January. Crude energy materials were up 2.6 pct, much less than the 10 pct rise in January. Crude petroleum prices rose 4.4 pct last month after a sharp 19.7 pct rise in January. Price rises accellerated for logs and timber and tobacco, but fell for cotton, metal ores and copper and aluminum scrap.

Heading off challenges to its Third World debt strategy, U.S. officials also say they think concessions should be made to debtors that enact reforms speeding inflation-free growth. In particular, they stress new techniques that shift the emphasis from debt to equity and shave interest rates. \"The strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative or concept that there can be additional emphasis such as in debt-equity swaps and that sort of thing,\" a Reagan administration official said of the slow pace of commercial bank lending to the Third World. \"The debtors have been performing well...some people argue that taking 1-1/8 pct down to 13/16 pct is debt forgiveness. Well if that\\'s what it is, fine. What it really is a narrowing of the spread that could be charged on new money,\" the official said. This week, therefore, U.S. officials signaled their backing for a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partial payment of interest in tradeable investment notes. On Tuesday, officials said Treasury Secretary James Baker told Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creative one and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance Minister Jamie Ongpin later that day. An administration official told Reuters this week the Philippines\\' proposal to partially pay interest with investment notes instead of cash should be considered seriously by the banks. An agreement with the banks, officials now say, is expected soon. \"New bank lending has been slow in materializing but the fact of the matter is there have been 70 billion dlrs in bank loans restructured, which is a form of extension of credit. As you know, there\\'s been 8.5 billion dlrs in new money,\" said the official, who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat. The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Baker and called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29 billion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtors undertaking reforms that promoting economic growth. But it has taken almost six months to complete the syndication of a 7.5 billion dlrs loan to Mexico, which has created deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such large straight cash loans being assembled ever again. U.S. officials want the banks not only to consider swapping their debts for equity in local corporations -- a development that has already met with success in Chile and Mexico -- but to pin loans on specific projects, finance trade and invest directly in debtor country private sectors. These forms of lending, they say, give the banks a greater stake and more economically secure return on investment. In a major challenge to the U.S. plan, Brazil last month declared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it up with a world tour by officials seeking a political way out of its 109 billion dlr debt burden. The country is beset by a falling trade surplus and dwindling reserves endangering its ability to service its foreeign debt, at 109 billion dlrs the Third World\\'s largest. One official attending the Washington talks with Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said \"they\\'ve come in here now and said \"Look, we\\'re out of money, help us,\" but they haven\\'t come in with a plan. And they\\'ve gone all over the world, and at every stop they\\'ve been told the same thing.\" The official said Brazil would have to enact a credible economic program, either in consultation with the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economy before commercial banks would begin negotiations. As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks and major debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reach agreements stretching out debt repayments. For its part, the administration has signaled its strong support for new techniques that in some cases effectively amount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations. It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual instead of bi-annual interest payments, speeding an accord. Administration officials, who asked not to be named, have also debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility in building up loan loss reserves against Third World loans. The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB-15, under which banks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estate loans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if it is believed payments will resume. More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm and energy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, has suggested it should be extended to Third World loans. Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging that provisions for debt relief be attached to tough new trade legislation now being considered on Capitol Hill. But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive. Reuter \\n',\n",

Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said. Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to three at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railways official said. \"Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade and all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu,\" he said. However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causing bottlenecks on the lake route too. Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported delays in coffee export shipments last January due to congestion on the lake ferries. Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda\\'s export earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid the higher costs of road haulage.

Citicorp is the largest bank group in the U.S. and one of the biggest lenders to Latin America, with some eight to nine billion dlrs outstanding to Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, bank analysts said. In response to more specific market rumors that it had taken action on its exposure to Brazil, Citicorp said it made an 8-K filing on the subject with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday in relation to a registration statement for a preferred stock issue. Citing the filing, Citicorp said that Brazil\\'s recent suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt and related actions \"may require Citicorp to place 3.9 billion dlrs of intermediate and long-term Brazilian loans on a cash basis.\" When loans are placed on a cash basis, interest or principal payments are only booked when received instead of being accrued on their due dates, analysts noted. However, Citicorp said in the 8-K filing that \"it is premature to make such a decision at this time in view of the fluidity of the situation and management\\'s high confidence in the long-term outlook for Brazil.\" Brazil\\'s new central bank governor Francisco Gros met senior commercial bankers here on Wednesday and Citicorp said formal talks on Brazil\\'s recent actions and future financing needs should begin in \"the near future\". Citicorp said in the filing, \"the issue will be re-evaluated at the end of the first quarter.\" The bank group continued, \"if it is decided that these loans to Brazil should be placed on a cash basis, Citicorp estimates, based on existing interest rates, that the impact in the first quarter would be approximately 50 mln dlrs after tax and for the full year would be approximately 190 mln dlrs after tax.\" It added that these amounts include interest accrued in 1986 that has not yet been collected. Although Citicorp denied earlier rumors of major loan writedowns, its warning that it may have to place some of its Brazilian loans on non-accrual unnerved many Wall Street investors.

       " 'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY\\nThe European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe\\'s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world\\'s first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system\\'s founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d\\'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one economist who has closely watched the system\\'s development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system\\'s greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark\\'s rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc, Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain\\'s failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government\\'s attitude is expected before the country\\'s next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system\\'s last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC\\'s highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. \"Technical measures won\\'t be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank\\'s economic research department. Economists say the system\\'s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. REUTER \\n',\n",

General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its return on average equity was 31.6 pct.

Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week. The talks are due to last until March 20. Xuto said, \"There is nothing concrete yet, but the atmosphere is good.\" The discussions are expected to continue late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings. Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure. Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price. It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called the \"lower indicative price,\" under certain circumstances. This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price, and the \"may buy\" (or \"may sell\") and \"must buy\" or \"must sell\" levels, without changing the \"lower indicative price\" -- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current pact. Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

       " 'U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT\\nProposals for a secondary market for the resale of farm real estate loans similar to home mortgage markets is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be established this year, Congressional and financial sources said. Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore, Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market. Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture \"as long as the farm credit system is a key player.\" Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively. Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said. Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market because they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system, traditionally the largest lender to farmers. A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high-quality loans on farmland to \"poolers\" who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for resale to investors-- called Aggie-mae by some supporters. However, the FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea. The ambivalence is because any farm secondary market established in the private sector that excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage. That could be a financial blow to the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years, Naylor and farm credit system officials have said. A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers, concludes the farm credit system\\'s market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established. The study was released earlier today. Reuter \\n',\n",

The sources said the ratings were lowered to M from O-plus. The stock are now expected to match the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, rather than outperform the index as previously expected. The sources said it is also understood that the change in the coding of these stocks should definitely not be taken as a sell-recommendation because Salomon is said to believe that its downgrading will only prove temporary.

       " \"GERMAN SECURITIES MAY BE COUNTED IN LENDING RATIOS\\nWest German banking authorities are considering requiring German banks to bring securities holdings into lending ratio calculations used to regulate credit risk, banking sources said. The present interpretation of the credit law limits banks' maximum lending to 18 times eligible capital -- reserves plus equity capital -- but sets no restraints on securities holdings. Under new provisions, weightings would be attached to securities similar to those used for lending. Weightings would range from a zero rating for no-risk assets to 100 pct of total asset value for what authorities consider the highest risk. Low-risk securities carrying a zero rating would include public authority bonds for the federal government, states and municipalities, the sources said. A 20 pct rating would be assigned to issues of domestic banks. Secured bonds of mortgage, shipping and public authority banks would be an exception to this, via such securities as mortgage and municipal bonds. Securities issued by foreign banks would attract a weighting of 50 pct, while authorities are considering requiring banks to include 100 pct of the value of debt assets of foreign issuers, including sovereign borrowers. The sources said the revision is still being discussed, and required approval by the federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin, the Bundesbank, and West Germany's four banking associations.

January is the first major export month and the figures thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said. Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000 tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking at the end of 1985, they added.

Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was 12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.

Murray said in his report to shareholders, \"that lower debt and our strong cash and marketable securities position improves Mobil\\'s flexibility.\" Long term debt as of December 31, 1986 was put at 7.9 billion dlrs, down 15 pct from 9.3 billion dlrs on the same day in 1985. Mobil has moved to reduce debt at high interest rates, which may reduce interest payments. Murray said that with the results from 1986, \"we\\'re paying back 3.8 billion dlrs in the past two years, or the equivalent of 66 pct of the debt incurred in 1984 when we bought Superior Oil.\" Mobil said that it has about 183 mln dlrs of long term debt which is due in 1987 although this will rise appreciably to 1.2 billion dlrs of long term debt due in 1988. At the end of 1986, Mobil said it also had an existing effective shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commmission to permit the sale of 205 mln dlrs of debt. Mobil\\'s debt reduction program has also been abetted by several steps taken by the company to restructure its operations. Mobil\\'s Murray said in his remarks to shareholders that the company was continuing to dispose of assets which did not fit the company\\'s long range plans and had realized some 1.1 billion dlrs from the sale of its Container Corp subsidiary. Murray said that as a result of lower debt and more efficient operations \"the company is now is a position to seize opportunities that may become available and use this strength in whatever way best builds shareholder value.\" Reuter \\n',\n",

Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U.S. official.

An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said. Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said. Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier estimates of 150,000, the official said.

       " 'FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY\\nU.S. February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said. \"If you\\'re the Fed, there\\'s no reason to do anything,\" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. \"There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation front, all is well,\" he said. \"Money supply is well under control. It\\'s an absolutely ideal situation.\" February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected. This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January\\'s production number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase. The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct, less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct rise in the PPI in January. \"The Fed is going to look at this positively,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. \"Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.\" The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January. \"This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel,\" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"The trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.\" In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct decline in the PPI. Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected, but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve. \"The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International. While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar. \"The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,\" he said. \"We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with foreign producers.\" Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct in February\\'s PPI. With many electronic goods produced overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said. If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices. By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987. Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers\\' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar. David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S. industrial output. \"It\\'s the other side of the lower dollar,\" Wyss said. \"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output.\" Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter. \"It\\'s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive.\" But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output. Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production. Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2 pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained. Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5 million units. \"In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate,\" Roach said. \"The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories.\" Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987. January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the largest monthly sales drop on record. Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes. \"The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months,\" Ramirez said. \"They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months.\" Reuter \\n',\n",
       " 'U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT\\nA secondary market for resale of farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be set up this year, Congressional and financial sources said. Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore, Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market. Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration, FCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture \"as long as the farm credit system is a key player.\" Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively. Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government National Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said. Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system, traditionally the largest lender to farmers. A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high-quality loans on farmland to \"poolers,\" who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for resale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents. The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because any farm secondary market established in the private sector which excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years, Naylor and farm credit system officials have said. However, the system and FCA have become more positive to the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were appointed the agent for a secondary market. \"If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools of farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees charged for providing this service,\" the Life Insurers\\' study said. Congressional sources believe a secondary market available to both private lenders and the farm credit system, with the system as agent, could be included in a major federal government rescue package for the system to be drafted by Congress later this year. A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers, concludes that the farm credit system\\'s market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established. The study was released earlier today. The study said a secondary market could be established with virtually no federal money if the government provided a guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private co-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses. It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years, expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea. The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market. The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why leading U.S. farm organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea. Proponents say a secondary market also would increase liquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans. Reuter \\n',\n",

Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures have been cut every year since 1984\\'s 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985. Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts \"the company has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and Indonesia. Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring of its domestic exploration and development organization and this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which support the new affiliate. \"Mobil\\'s chairman has explained this change by saying we need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our assets,\" said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman. Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which will combine its current three exploration and producing affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present organization and will improve the company\\'s upstream competitive position. Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance the development and transfer of technology supporting critical areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and computer systems. Earnings from Mobil\\'s upstream operations in 1986 were 827 mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year\\'s 1.8 billion dlrs in earnings.

       " \"BRAZILIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE OIL REFINERIES\\nBrazil's labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three days ago. The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal. A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country's main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday. A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports. Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase. Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end. Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike. The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday. Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator. Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector. On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates. Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana. The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance. On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks. Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange. Reuter \\n\",\n",

       " 'TALKING POINT/BANK STOCKS\\nCitiCorp <CCI> appears to be digging in its heels for tough negotiations over the billions of dollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, Wall Street analysts said. \"I view it as pre-negotiation posturing,\" said analyst Carole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to both Brazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on its commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first quarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it lists the loans as non-performing status. Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating a material change in its financial situation. \"Citicorp is saying you can\\'t scare us with threats, we\\'ll make your loans non-performing right now,\" Berger said. The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90 days without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation will be reviewed at the end of the current quarter. Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by talking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between U.S. and European banks. Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is unlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half of this year. \"Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on all the interest they owe,\" Cohn said. \"The real issue is the rescheduling of debt terms. Another question is whether or not the International Monetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program. Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in late dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off their lows by midday as investors took the news in stride. Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on non-performing loans are reported for each bank. But he said investors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at present levels for the \"tremendous fundamental values\" in the group. Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC) has the greatest exposure to Brazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of earnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among New York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co <JPM> and Bankers Trust Co <BT> which happen to have the least exposure. Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have lower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. In fact he said there\\'s a chance those banks could get more involved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up a brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed countries. \"I don\\'t see any reason to change full year earnings estimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He thinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a situation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985. Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became non-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks came to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was paid. \"What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,\" he said. He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is a worst-case outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that Brazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through some economic upheaval after the transition from a military to a civilian government. \"The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative to their ability to service it,\" said John Mason of Interstate Securities. \"We\\'ve been fiddling around with these problems for five years and the hour is growing late.\" He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut interest rates internally and extended maturities and none of these measures has been enough. He expects re-classification of as much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he sees partial write downs of some loans. Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks could be poised for a short term rally. A spokesman at First Chicago Corp <FNB> said it is premature to put Brazil\\'s loans on a cash basis. \"It is our expectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet its debt,\" a spokesman said. Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to make a decision. Several other banks queried by Reuters said much the same thing.

They said it would take about two months and at least 15 mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's Pacific Ocean coast. The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said. The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about 17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said. The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand. The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before. The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific Ocean. Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the earthquake.

       " 'NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING\\nA greater than anticipated need, competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials said. As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely. First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year\\'s Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain. A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said. Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes. Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year\\'s corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR. \"Significant downside potential\" still exists for the Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow. \"If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period,\" he said. Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying. U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet sources said. \"This price difference makes American corn competitive,\" Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union, told Reuters. Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said. Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat. In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out. Reuter \\n',\n",

In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank and Financial Analysts\\' Association, Heller said, \"I believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.\" He said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift, insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines. \"Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would have to be on an arms-length basis,\" Heller said. Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks\\' special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries. Heller said he \"would require the holding company to serve as a \\'source of strength\\' to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank\\'s capital. \"In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth.\" Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company, again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary. Heller said the effects of these actions \"would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them\" in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to \"loot the bank\" was removed. Such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the United States.

BP now owns 55 pct of Standard\\'s stock. Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not identify, as saying BP\\'s careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer. \"I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation,\" he said. \"Let\\'s wait and see how the offer runs.\" Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid. The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times Standard\\'s 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company\\'s assets, including the value of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC> paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times cash flow. The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard\\'s stock price over the past year. BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two-third\\'s of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be financed by new debt. BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit, he explained. The company\\'s debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months, he added. Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil\\'s publicly held shares are held by financial institutions. Simon said Standard\\'s board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time. He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition. \"We have informed Washington of our intentions and we\\'ve already been an integral part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves,\" he pointed out. Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production. \"We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime,\" Simon said. \"We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see prices going much higher,\" he added.

       " 'BP<BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES\\nBritish Petroleum Plc\\'s plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. \"I think that BP\\'s bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,\" said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own. \"It\\'s a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack,\" said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. \"Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets,\" Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp <AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp <UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil\\'s stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices. \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said. \"They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded,\" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil\\'s brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves. \"I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market,\" Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP\\'s visibility ahead of the British government\\'s announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP\\'s reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S. \"The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock,\" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua. In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs. Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'PARIS G-6 MEET SET NO TARGETS - LEIGH-PEMBERTON\\nBank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets. Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that \"we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding\" on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels. He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint currency float - but one which let it still purse an independent monetary policy. \"I would concede that, since the Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. \"The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together\" towards stabilising exchange rates,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. He did not mention this week\\'s intervention by central banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the accord. Leigh-Pemberton said that \"the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days\" before September 1985. He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that \"we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.\" He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that \"we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.\" Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower, he said \"the two half point cuts (this month in banks\\' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now.\" Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a \"cautious step-by-step approach\" to reducing short term interest rates, not least because \"we have a potential problem with inflation.\" Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, \"one of the highest\" among industrialised nations, he added. Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct. Regarding sterling\\'s relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall. He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England\\'s sterling index, when compared with the index\\'s level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level.

Bank of Montreal had 1.98 billion dlrs in loans to Brazil as of last September 30, the most of any Canadian bank. Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Asked if Bank of Montreal were considering declaring its Brazil loans non-performing, Reuber replied: \"We haven\\'t really got to that point because we don\\'t think we will have to face that issue.\" Some bankers in the U.S. said earlier this week that slow progress in talks between Brazil and its major foreign lenders has increased the likelihood that U.S. banks will declare their Brazil loans non-performing at the end of the quarter.

He said price would help determine if the bank formed its own securities unit or acquired an existing investment dealer, adding that asking prices for some dealers seem \"fairly high.\" Asked about plans for wholly owned Harris Bankcorp Inc, of Chicago, Reuber said Harris might consider acquiring more small community banks around Chicago. \"In addition, I think we are giving some consideration to the possibility of extension into other states,\" Reuber said of Harris, although he added that any such move was unlikely this year. In his speech, focusing on current free trade talks between the U.S. and Canada, Reuber said failure to reach a deal would not represent a calamity for Canada but could lower Canada\\'s standard of living, raise unemployment and reduce the country\\'s world trading influence.

But they described market response as muted because the S and P action came as no surprise. Besides, many participants had already shied away from bank issues following Brazil\\'s suspension of interest payments last month, traders added. \"The downgrades were expected for some time. In fact, you can argue that S and P is lagging the market,\" commented one trader. On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interest payments on about 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial banks. No date was established for the renewal of payments. In its action, Standard and Poor\\'s cited the exposure to major Latin American debtor countries of Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB>, Chemical New York Corp <CHL>, Irving Bank Corp <V> and Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>. The rating agency also downgraded Mellon Financial Corp <MEL> and Security Pacific Corp <SPC>, but said this reflected higher non-performing assets and weaker operating results rather than the international debt problem. \"The S and P downgrades were a non-event,\" a trader said. \"Anyone who was caught unaware was not on top of the situation anyway.\" Said another trader, \"People talked about this before and after S and P\\'s announcement. There was not much reaction among bank issues today, though prices are still below par.\" Still, market watchers said the action further undermined sentiment for bank paper. Because of Brazil\\'s suspension of interest payments, U.S. bank paper has underperformed such other sectors as utilities, telephones and industrials, analysts pointed out. Even though Standard and Poor\\'s affirmed the debt ratings of Citicorp <CCI>, Bankers Trust New York <BT>, Bank of Boston Corp <BKB> and J.P.

       " 'FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER\\nFrench Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these markets. The EC Commission\\'s proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here. \"I give you my word that France, while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms,\" Guillaume told the annual conference of the country\\'s major farm union, FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles). Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88. Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months. There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output. But Guillaume\\'s warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA\\'s farmers. His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts, MCA\\'s, however, are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers. Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission\\'s proposals to overhaul the farm sector. \"The Minister\\'s proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks,\" he told reporters, adding that this could also act in Guillaume\\'s favour on a ministerial level. Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring. Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister. There have been certain advances on cutting production costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers\\' indebtedness, he said. Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire. The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid, Lacombe said. Reuter \\n',\n",

The sources said they believe the committed four year revolving credit - the largest of its kind in the euromarkets - carries a facility fee of 1/8 pct and that drawings will be at 1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor). Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, which is arranging the financing in conjunction with its London operation, was not available to commment on the terms. BP announced it was arranging the financing earlier today as part of its planned tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co that it does not own already. In addition to the revolving credit, BP also is arranging a U.S. commercial paper program for an as yet undetermined amount, which will be supported by the revolver. Bankers noted that the terms on the new facility compare extremely favourably to those on other short-term facilities for which pricing has turned extremely fine due to competition for the mandates. It also contrasts with the 1/16 pct fee BP paid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing of some existing debt. Earlier today a Morgan Guaranty official, while declining to reveal the pricing on the facility said that banks would be \"compensated fairly\" since this is a special purpose facility which must be completed quickly, with the signing expected in about 10 days.

Lead managers are being recruited at the 200 mln dlr level, co-lead managers at 125 mln and managers at 75 mln.

The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries such as Italy. These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3 pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985. They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance. On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986 of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a previous deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and compares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985. Reuter \\n\",\n",

The agency cited British Petroleum's 7.4 billion dlr tender offer today for the remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil shares it does not already own. Moody's said that while British Petroleum has greatly strengthened its capital structure over the past few years, this acquisition would seriously affect the company's liquidity, leverage and interest coverage. Moody's noted that British Petroleum would use more than two billion dlrs of excess cash and marketables and about five billion dlrs of new acquisition debt to fund the transaction. In addition, the minority interest and deferred income taxes attributable to Standard Oil would be excluded from British Petroleum's capitalization. That would result in a total debt to capital ratio of nearly 50 pct, Moody's said. The rating agency said it would study B.P.'s strategy to restore financial flexibility after the acquisition. Moody's said that may include divestiture of various petroleum and non-petroleum assets and operations of B.P. and Standard. But Moody's noted that after the major asset writedown and divestiture progress achieved by Standard Oil in 1985, fewer non-petroleum assets are available for sale.

Rothschild. And despite BP managing director David Simon\\'s denial today that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility. Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell Group\\'s <RD> <SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after lawsuits by minority shareholders. \"I think they\\'re going to have to go a little higher eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares,\" Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share. Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984. But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil, Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase. It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of about 5.2 billion dlrs. The analysts made their comments before Simon\\'s remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon. Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share. Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason, they said.

U.S. officials say that while Japan has stopped dumping semiconductors on the American market, they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has remained all but closed to the U.S. semiconductors. semiconductors on the American market, they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has remained all but closed to the U.S. semiconductors. reuter \\n\",\n",

       " 'OIL EXECUTIVES SEE GRADUAL RISE IN PRICES\\nTop executives with Tenneco Corp <TGT> and Sabine Corp <SAB> said they expected world oil prices to gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on imports of oil from the Middle East grows. \"I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a trend of gradually increasing prices,\" C.W. Nance, president of Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association. Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the rate of 80 pct of capacity. The gain will come largely through increased imports to the United States, he said. \"They will be able to raise the price again but I do not think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,\" Nance said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected. Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20 dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in 1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988. \"Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand,\" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry\\'s outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct, he said. Tenneco\\'s Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry\\'s reduced deliverability. Tenneco\\'s gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20 pct during 1986, he said. \"This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,\" Nance said. \"We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three years before we start to climb out?\" J.C. Walter of <Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects. \"If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,\" Walter said. He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel, Walter said. Reuter \\n',\n",
       " 'REPORT SAYS SOVIET ECONOMIC PLANS TOO OPTIMISTIC\\nThe Soviet economy has grown at an increased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s leadership, but his goals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S. intelligence agencies. The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the Congressional Joint Economic committee, which released it. It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986, Gorbachev\\'s first full year in power, twice the average rate of growth over the previous 10 years. Gorbachev\\'s policies to improve worker attitudes, remove incompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and modernize the country\\'s industrial equipment accounted for some of the gains, the report said. \"Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has adopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his efforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term solutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors lacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev\\'s program appears too ambitious on a number of counts,\" the report said. Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union said Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years if he continues his reform policies. \"I don\\'t think he can last four years,\" Marshall Goldman of Harvard University told a Congressional hearing. \"He\\'s moving so fast, he\\'s stepping on so many toes.\" A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the Smithsonian Institution\\'s Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian studies. The economic report said meeting targets for commodity output would require unrealistic gains in productivity and industrial output targets appear too high to allow time to install more advanced equipment. None of Gorbachev\\'s proposals would change the system of economic incentives that has discouraged innovation and technological change, the report added. \"The first significant resistance to specific policies, although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the massive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among enterprise managers who complained that they were being asked to carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality standards and output targets simultaneously,\" the report said. The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in the Soviet economy over the next several years. It said the Soviet Union trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advanced manufacturing technologies, such as computers and microprocessors. Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'FED DATA INDICATE POLICY LIKELY TO STAY ON HOLD\\nFederal Reserve data released today indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks and that none is likely at next week\\'s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said. \"The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year,\" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. \"These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. \"The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There\\'s no real reason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges. All of the economists agreed that the Fed\\'s major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further. Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year. The Fed said that banks\\' net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period. In the single week to Wednesday, banks\\' borrowings at the discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct. The Fed\\'s failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves. The Fed\\'s absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg. Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period. Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct. It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said Wells Fargo\\'s Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6-1/4 pct band. Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today. More Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs. To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar coupon \"pass\" may be required later. There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31. Reuter \\n',\n",

By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers \"would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said. \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,\" the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,\" the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar. \"Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade.\" But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar\\'s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said. Developing countries\\' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said. The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports. REUTER \\n',\n",

Banking sources in London had been quoted earlier as saying the British banks were balking at signing the package in an effort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new 7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the deal. However, the Finance Ministry statement said all the British banks had promised their participation in the loan. \"The contribution of each one of them corresponds exactly to the request of the Mexican government,\" the statememt said. The ministry said Citibank, which chairs Mexico\\'s bank advisory committee, has received cables from the British banks \"confirming said commitment.\" The ministry said the books on the package would be closed by mid-April and the first 3.5 billion dlrs of the new money should arrive by the end of the month. It also said French, Swiss and \"some\" Canadian banks had subscribed to the package and that the remaining Canadian banks would sign the accord in the next few days. REUTER \\n',\n",

       " 'INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP\\nIndia is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India\\'s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India\\'s 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country\\'s large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC\\'s recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. \"MMTC\\'s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said. \"We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,\" he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars. But despite India\\'s new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added. \"It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced,\" one trade source said. \"The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants.\" Another added, \"Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty. \"This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country\\'s foreign trade policy.\" REUTER \\n',\n",

The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit attributed the deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss. It said government compensation, in the form of subsidies to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group's oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit. BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend. Commenting on the year's performance, the company said it suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices.

The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry today and approval is expected later this month, the officials said. Under the plan, the four companies will set floor prices for exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar, reduced world demand caused by lower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in price-cutting competition, the officials said. In calendar 1986, seamless pipe exports fell to 2.34 mln tonnes from 2.99 mln in 1985 and 3.12 mln in 1981.

A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per \"B\" share, while the \"A\" share dividend will be maintained at last year\\'s level of 40 cents a share.

Shareholders\\' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said. It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG>, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan. He said the group\\'s stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is \"a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance.\" Keswick said the issue of new \"B\" shares will give the group \"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group\\'s recent restructuring.\" He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm\\'s shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price. The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation, with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to the new unit <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two companies spun off from Hk Land -- <Mandarin Oriental International Ltd> and <Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd> -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.

He noted the firm last year sold interests in airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities. Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its general trading business in the Middle East in view of the continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said.

Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement. Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs. BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1. The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1. The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said. BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital. The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said. As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate. BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln. BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties. The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.

       " 'PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES\\nPhilippine sugar production in the 1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes, up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said. Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate would almost certainly be met. He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption. Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market. He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target. \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by July,\" Yulo said. Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos. Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved. The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry. Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino. \"I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But there is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level.\" \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulo said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul, up from 190 pesos last August. Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRA\\'s bid to control production. \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\" he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production. He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry. \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said. \"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to call this a \\'sugarcane industry\\' instead of the sugar industry.\" He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling. \"When you cut sugarcane you don\\'t even have to produce sugar,\" he said. Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984. \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said. \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed, particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\" He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60 cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound. \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year,\" he said. Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990, with world consumption outstripping production. He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup. \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" he said. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut ours in half without any justification.\" Manila was keenly watching Washington\\'s moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents. The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.

In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S. Firms that have expressed interest. But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said. The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete with the current monopoly <Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.\\'s Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said. One of the rival firms, <International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms including General Electric Co <GE>, Ford Motor Co <F> and Citibank NA <CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president Nobuo Ito said yesterday. Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second potential KDD rival, <International Digital Communications Planning Inc>, along with <C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc <PAC>, both of the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor. It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless, arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists. Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless\\' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct, the ministry official said. Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless\\' share, industry analysts said. \"Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor,\" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst Darrell Whitten said. \"Political ...

       " 'TRADE SURPLUS WILL POSE ADDED PRESSURES FOR JAPAN\\nJapan today announced another mammoth monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action. \"The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not moving more quickly,\" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist Eric Rasmussen said. The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in January and 4.77 billion a year ago. The current account surplus, which includes trade in services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago. After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from a record 9.58 billion in January. \"In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off further protectionism or further yen strength,\" said William Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on world markets while making imports into the country cheaper. \"On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some progress on getting exports down,\" Jardine\\'s Rasmussen said. But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said. Finance Ministry officials blamed last month\\'s slower import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked off stocks they had built up in January. The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase in January. This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact on exports, they said.

       " 'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY\\nRecent slackness on Dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank\\'s policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy. While agreeing with the Bank\\'s commitment to defend the guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System (EMS). Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV (Amro) said the Central Bank\\'s policy was overcautious. \"I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the EMS,\" Nelissen said at the presentation of Amro\\'s 1986 annual report last week. Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100. The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate. The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands. Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short. Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain.\" Amro\\'s Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he added. Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central Bank\\'s policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters, noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency. \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added. Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries, as the economic performance of the two does not differ much, economists said. Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month. Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates. West Germany is the Netherlands\\' largest single trading partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of Statistics figures show. At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a rate of around 5-7/16 pct. Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany. In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month. German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts. But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank. Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22, the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5 pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said. The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted. While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow. \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of a third currency,\" Central Bank vice-director Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said. \"If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the markets would start to believe it was weak.

       " 'WORLD BANK CHIEF URGES MORE JAPANESE INVESTMENT\\nWorld Bank President Barber Conable called on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, for its own sake as well as that of the world economy. \"Japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the Third World,\" he told about 500 Japanese businessmen and academics. \"I would be pleased with additional support.\" With 25 pct of the world\\'s total banking assets, Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said. Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan\\'s advantage. It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America, China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world, he said. Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank\\'s concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.

       " \"NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE\\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now.

       " 'SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE\\nReports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said. The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India, Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China. Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added. Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar. Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block enquiries by China, they said. Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously, they added. Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some 1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said. Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around 229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added. Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders said. Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.

He added the executive Commission has not yet decided whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm produce. Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and other food have been authorised for distribution under an operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in which charities act as executive Commission agents. The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's unusually cold European winter. The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal snowstorms, for the month of April. Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate next month. He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further, will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent. Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European currency units, would be a major consideration.

       " 'INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP\\nIndia is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India\\'s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India\\'s 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country\\'s large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC\\'s recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. \"MMTC\\'s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'PAPANDREOU SAYS GREEKS READY FOR AGGRESSORS\\nGreek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens \"the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.\" He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean. \"The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,\" General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference. He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area. The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover. Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests \"because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements.\" Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said \"If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war.\" But he added \"We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights.\" Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached. In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations \"we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words.\" Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only \"The Greek fleet is not at its naval base.\" Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf. Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it. Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus. He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied \"Obviously, and perhaps even before the war.\" REUTER \\n',\n",

Porsche AG <PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactory profit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but U.S. Sales anticipated higher. Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales were expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from 11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000 from 28,670 last year. Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70 mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86. For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this year to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254, Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he added. The expected drop in West German sales this year would be the result of the so-called \"grey market\" for Porsche cars, he said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal export to the U.S. Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87 first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period. The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose problems for profit, the Porsche board said. In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around 20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the 1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki. Branitzki put Porsche\\'s hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln marks. In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-party orders placed with Porsche\\'s engineering research centre in Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for the first time.

       " 'COCOA BUFFER STOCK COMPROMISE GAINING ACCEPTANCE\\nA final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates said. \"We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we still have some work to do,\" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana told Reuters after a producers\\' meeting. European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted \"no problems\" in getting full consumer acceptance. Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they said. The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations. The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted. Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him. The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as \"just fiddling.\" But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said. The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or forward positions, delegates said. If the compromise is accepted by the council, most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week, or as soon as practically possible. The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet before the council.

Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India\\'s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India\\'s 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.

Although banks are anxious to develop a market for medium term notes, only a few companies such as Electrolux AB and Pepsico Inc have gone so far as to arrange one. Commercial Union is the first U.K. Company to set up such a program. Cameron-Smail said the company seeks to help the development of such a market as it would provide a new funding base for its medium term assets.

In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenues of 10.7 billion dlrs. Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, Douglas Danforth, Westinghouse\\'s chairman, said the company\\'s sales growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, \"given an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth course.\" He also said the company will make acquisitions, but he did not specify particular targets. Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told the analysts \"our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr acquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one. Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will consider it.\" He said the company would consider an acquisition candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse\\'s primiary businesses. Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key areas including defense electronics, financial services, broadcasting, electrical products and services for construction and industrial and utility markets. Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse\\'s sales to grow faster than the markets the corportation serves and \"surely faster than GNP.\" He said earnings per share growth is expected to consistently exceed the Standard and Poor\\'s 500 index and return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range. Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance, told the analysts \"we will consider buying back stock\" but there are no current plans for such a buyback. Yochum said that at the company\\'s current level of earnings it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder value. Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs restructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation, assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the company spent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344 mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in 1988. He also said, capital expenditures should be about 400 mln dlrs in 1987. Reuter \\n',\n",

       " 'RABOBANK ISSUE IN HEAVY DEMAND ON AMSTERDAM BOURSE\\nA new Rabobank mortgage bond, whose terms dealers considered extremely generous, was in heavy demand on the Amsterdam bourse today, bond dealers said. Rabobank, not anticipating a strong two-day rally in Dutch bonds, on Wednesday set an issue price of 99.50 pct for a 6.25 pct eight-year open mortgage bond, giving it a yield about 1/4 pct higher than the market average. Rabobank stopped trading in the bond five minutes after the bourse opened, but already between 200 and 300 mln guilders worth had been sold, a Rabobank spokesman said. One Japanese investor took 50 mln guilders alone, a dealer said. Later, the bank proposed to allot only 30 pct of subscriptions, causing a general outcry among traders. Rabobank finally gave in to bourse demands to honour all subscriptions. \"We simply did not expect prices to rise so much,\" a Rabobank spokesman said.\" Since the pricing, the bond price index has risen 0.9 to 117.3, and the average state loan yield has fallen accordingly to 6.04 pct. Two weeks ago, Rabobank issued a 250 mln guilder 6.75 pct bond at par, giving it a yield 0.40 above the average bank loan yields that day of 6.35 pct. The issue was heavily over-subscribed.

General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, said today the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said \"The military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.\" The row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover.

       " 'title': 'INCO SEES NO MAJOR IMPACT FROM DOW REMOVAL Inco Ltd said it did not expect its earlier reported removal from the Dow Jones industrial index to make a major impact on the company\\'s stock. \"We don\\'t think that individuals or institutions buy our shares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,\" spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query. Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco was dropped to make the index more representative of the market. Inco, the non-Communist world\\'s largest nickel producer, was a member of the index since 1928. Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Co and Boeing Co, effective tomorrow. Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said Inco\\'s removal from the index would likely spark short-term selling pressure on the stock. \"Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, \\'well, because it\\'s not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that investment,\\'\" said Martens, although he added the move was unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock. Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in 1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year. Reuter'}"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
